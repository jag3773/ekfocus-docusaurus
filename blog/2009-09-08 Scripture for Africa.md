I've been sending this to some missions agencies working in Africa in hopes that this new and free service will be taken advantage of.  If you know anyone involved in missions in Africa please pass this information along to them.

>To Whom It May Concern,
>
>I'm writing to let you know about an exciting technology which you may not be aware of.  Because the majority of African people have access to a cell phone Google is in the process of launching a large SMS (text message) service for Africa.  Essentially, anyone in Africa would be able to send a SMS query to a specific Google number and they will receive a response SMS containing the result(s) of their query.
>
>The exciting part about this is that a user could enter the query 'bible john 3:16' and they would receive the text of John 3:16 in response.  I am praying that those currently involved in missions in Africa will find this useful.

>For more information please see Google's web page regarding this service here: http://www.google.co.ug/mobile/sms/#6006.

>Please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further service.
