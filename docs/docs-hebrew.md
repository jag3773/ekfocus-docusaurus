## Hebrew Resources

This section contains resources for learning and using Biblical Hebrew. I encourage you to check out the sites listed below as well as the subpages.

- https://uhg.readthedocs.io/ - The unfoldingWord® Hebrew Grammar is a free and open source Hebrew reference grammar which corresponds to the morphology of the Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible (see next item).
- https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb - The Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible is the _Westminster Leningrad Codex_ (WLC) but fully parsed and tagged with Strong's numbers–free and open source!
- http://www.quisition.com/ - This website intelligently helps the user learn vocabulary. I have entered in all the vocabulary words that occur more than 46 times in the Hebrew Bible. Also, vocabulary has been entered according to the chapters in [_Basics of Biblical Hebrew_](https://www.amazon.com/Basics-Biblical-Hebrew-Grammar-Second/dp/0310520673/). You can also download a zip file of the [Hebrew Vocabulary Lists](/zip/HebrewVocabularyLists.zip).
